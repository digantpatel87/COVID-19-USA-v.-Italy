## Proposal
Utilizing the datasets listed below, we plan on comparing the Covid-19 rates in the United States versus Italy. The dataset includes information from the onset of the pandemic until December 2020.

### Visio Diagram
Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).
The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)
<mark style="background-color: yellow">Note: the second link shoud fail, as you will not have a folder called __img__, nor the image file.</mark>

### Extract 
  • We retrieved data from two data sets from Kaggle:
      • https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa
      • https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-italy 
  • The assignment required that we use diverse data sources. To meet this requirement, we converted the USA data set from a CSV to JSON file. 


### Transform 
  • Following successful conversion of the USA data set, we cleaned our data and created tables.  
  • Then, we used Python to extract data from JSON and CSV.
