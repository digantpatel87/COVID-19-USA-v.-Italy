### Extract 
  • We retrieved data from [COVID-19 in USA](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa) and [COVID-19 in Italy](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-italy) from Kaggle. 
  
  • The assignment required that we use diverse data sources. To meet this requirement, we converted the USA data set from a CSV to JSON file. 


### Transform 
  • Following successful conversion of the USA data set, we cleaned our data and created tables.  
  • Then, we used Python to extract data from JSON and CSV.
